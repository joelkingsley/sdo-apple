We believe in baptism by immersion in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost.\n 4. We believe that the unsaved will spend eternity in torment in a literal hell.\n 5. We believe that Jesus is God, and that Jesus Christ was conceived of the Holy Ghost and born of the virgin Mary. We also believe in the doctrine of the Trinity where the Father, the Son, the Holy Ghost are three distinct persons.\n 6. We believe that Bible translations should use the Greek Textus Receptus as the only source instead of the Dead Sea Scrolls. In English, we endorse and use the King James Version of the Bible.";
