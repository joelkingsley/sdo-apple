## Code Analysis with CodeQL

You can create a CodeQL database for Swift code analysis and run custom queries as follows:

### Creating a CodeQL Database

Run the following command in your project root to generate a CodeQL database for Swift:

```sh
codeql database create ./databases/swift-database \
  --language=swift \
  --command="xcodebuild build -project SDO.xcodeproj -scheme \"SDO (iOS)\""
```

### Running CodeQL Queries

You can use the custom queries provided in the `queries/codeql-custom-queries-swift/` folder. For example, to run a query:

```sh
codeql query run --database=./databases/swift-database queries/codeql-custom-queries-swift/example.ql
```

Refer to the [CodeQL documentation](https://codeql.github.com/docs/codeql-cli/) for more details on advanced usage.
